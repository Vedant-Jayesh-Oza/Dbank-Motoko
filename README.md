# About the Project 

Dbank is a basic version of a Decentralized bank on Internet Computer Chain made using Dfinity's Motoko Language. This project is kind of inspired by the compound protocol which is called a money market protocol. Compound allows the people to lend and borrow the tokens. People can supply their ether and earn a little bit of interest on it or thety can borrow a token from the platform. Compound will collect the interest paid by the borrowers and pay out the interest to the people. 

# Feature of this project
The Project Dbank calculates the compound earned by your money and earns interest on the available token/money balance. Canister contains the code in motoko which is to be executed to topUp the balance token, Compound the available balance token and withdraw from the balance. A canister is like a smart contract because its execution is governed by a secure protocol: the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

#Use of Candid UI 
The Candid interface description language provides a common language for specifying the signature of a canister. Based on the type signature of the service offered by the smart contract, Candid provides a web interface—the Candid UI—that allows you to call canister functions for testing and debugging from a web browser without writing any frontend code.
